# Creature Creation Webapp PRD

## Introduction
A web-based application designed for children ages 3-8 to create and visualize their imagined creatures through a guided attribute selection process, utilizing AI-generated imagery with a colorful, cartoon-style aesthetic.

## Goals
1. Provide a fun, interactive platform for young children to express their creativity through creature design
2. Make the process of imagining and creating creatures accessible and engaging for young users
3. Deliver high-quality, cartoon-style AI-generated images that match children's expectations
4. Create an intuitive interface that requires minimal adult supervision

## User Stories
1. As a young child, I want to answer simple questions about my creature so I can see what it looks like
2. As a young child, I want to see colorful, cartoon-style images of my creature so I can recognize and enjoy them
3. As a young child, I want to easily navigate through the questions using simple buttons and visual prompts
4. As a parent, I want to see my child's creations so I can encourage their creativity

## Functional Requirements
1. User Interface
   1.1 The application must have a colorful, cartoon-style interface with large, easily clickable buttons
   1.2 All text must be simple and readable for young children
   1.3 The interface must be responsive and work on both desktop and tablet devices

2. Creature Attribute Selection
   2.1 The system must guide users through a series of questions about their creature's attributes
   2.2 Attributes must include:
      2.2.1 Size (small, medium, large)
      2.2.2 Color (primary and secondary)
      2.2.3 Habitat (land, water, air, space)
      2.2.4 Number of legs (0-4)
      2.2.5 Special features (wings, horns, tails, etc.)
   2.3 Each question must be presented with visual examples and simple text
   2.4 The system must validate user input to ensure all required attributes are selected

3. Image Generation
   3.1 The system must use AI to generate cartoon-style images based on selected attributes
   3.2 Generated images must maintain a consistent, colorful cartoon aesthetic
   3.3 Image generation should complete within 5-10 seconds
   3.4 The system must display the generated image in a prominent, easy-to-view area

4. Session Management
   4.1 The system should allow multiple creature creations in a single session
   4.2 Each creature creation should be timestamped
   4.3 The system should maintain a simple history of recent creations

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. The application will not include advanced editing capabilities for generated images
2. The application will not include sharing or social features
3. The application will not include user accounts or login functionality
4. The application will not include complex animation features

## Design Considerations
1. Visual Design
   1.1 Use bright, primary colors throughout the interface
   1.2 Maintain large touch targets for young users
   1.3 Include playful, cartoon-style illustrations in the interface
   1.4 Use large, clear fonts for all text
   1.5 Include visual feedback for all user interactions

2. Accessibility
   2.1 All interactive elements must be large enough for young children to use
   2.2 The interface should be intuitive with minimal text instructions
   2.3 Visual examples should be provided for all attribute options

## Technical Considerations
1. The application should use a modern web framework (e.g., React) for the frontend
2. AI image generation should be handled through a reliable API service
3. The application should be optimized for performance on low-end devices
4. Consider implementing caching for frequently used attribute combinations

## Success Metrics
1. User Engagement
   - Average time spent creating a creature: > 2 minutes
   - Average number of creatures created per session: > 2
   - User error rate (invalid selections): < 10%

2. Technical Performance
   - Image generation success rate: > 95%
   - Average image generation time: < 10 seconds
   - Application crash rate: < 1%

## Open Questions
1. Should we include a simple tutorial for first-time users?
2. Should we implement any parental controls or time limits?
3. What specific AI image generation service should we use?
4. Should we include a simple "undo" feature for attribute selection?
5. How should we handle browser compatibility for different devices?
